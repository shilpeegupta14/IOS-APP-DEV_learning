# DICEE-iOS13_App

Through Dicee-iOS App, I learnt how to create a user interactive UI button. 

I also learnt how @IBAction can connects the design to code and how @IBOutlet can connect code to design.

After this I randomise an array that consists of dice images from 1 to 6 and built an user interactive button to roll the dice.
