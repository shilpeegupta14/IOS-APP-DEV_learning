#Clima App

I made this app using MVC design pattern and Delegate Design Pattern.

I used the openWeatherMap.org apis to fetch Weather Data by making HTTP Requests with URLSession and
parsed the JSON with JSON Decoder.

The App also use CoreLocation Package to get GPS Data from phone

I also learnt asynchrous programmng topics like Dispatch Queues to update the UI after fetching data.

I did learnt about UITextFiels to get user input.
